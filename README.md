# Ember

Photo library & non-destructive RAW editor, maintained by **Orthic Labs**. Ember is based on [LightCraft](https://github.com/storytold/lightcraft) by ArtCraft Team & contributors, with our React/Tauri desktop workspace & RightKit integrations.

## Workspace

- **Library:** grid, bottom filmstrip, folders/collections, search, ratings, flags & metadata.
- **Develop:** left navigation & right editing panels, history, presets, crop, tone/color controls & masks. Rust processing stays authoritative; UI commands use shared engine contracts.
- **Import/export:** supported RAW & raster formats, XMP interoperability & Lightroom catalog import into an Ember library. Originals remain separate from non-destructive edits.
- **Automation:** engine commands, CLI/MCP & native control/hidden QA. [Control protocol](docs/control-protocol.md) documents interfaces.

React/Tauri targets **macOS & Windows**. Existing egui, Linux, web/WASM & CLI hosts remain in source. Format support & implementation gaps are tracked in [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) & [parity tracker](docs/parity.md); feature availability is not proof of Lightroom parity.

## Auto, masks & AI

Local Auto uses image statistics & deterministic processing; Adobe Auto quality parity is not established. Culling source adds cancellable background analysis, paged review & explicit undoable acceptance. [Culling evaluation](docs/culling-evaluation.md) defines shoot-level labels, CLI scoring & proposed qualification targets. Experimental YuNet/Candle face inference & [Personal Auto](docs/personal-auto-evaluation.md) training/evaluation remain unqualified. Denoise is classical processing. Optional [SAM 3 masking](docs/ai-masks.md) requires separately acquired model weights under Meta’s licence.

[OpenRouter photo assessment](crates/photo-ai/README.md) is an opt-in experiment for bounded, read-only model comparisons. It produces proposals, does not apply edits or delete/reject photos, & has no validated provider winner. Credentials & real-photo evaluation are separate from this branding change.

[Local AI delivery](docs/local-ai-delivery.md) records current source work & remaining gates: local culling first, qualified face/eye/similarity weights next, then cloud comparison & Personal Auto. ChatGPT-plan OAuth remains deferred.

## Release status

This fork is under active development. Fork `main` includes merged [React/Tauri PR #1](https://github.com/Orthic-Labs/lightcraft/pull/1), [OpenRouter PR #2](https://github.com/Orthic-Labs/lightcraft/pull/2) & [Ember branding PR #3](https://github.com/Orthic-Labs/lightcraft/pull/3). No React/Tauri PR has been submitted to upstream LightCraft.

Public builds, Rust tests & native qualification run through generated **RightKit GitHub Actions** (`.rightgit.json`). Local work is source/static-only. Only qualified green artifacts are promoted to desktop default. GitHub suspended this fork’s workflows for usage scale; [CI restoration](docs/ci-restoration.md) records API attempts & required maintainer re-enable control. Current source awaits native qualification. Source merges do not promote installed artifacts.

## Development

Rust workspace uses internal `lightcraft-*` crate/binary names for source & command compatibility. React source lives in `apps/lightcraft-desktop/web`; Tauri host lives in `apps/lightcraft-desktop`. RightKit versions are pinned by manifests & lockfiles; declarations alone do not establish integrated capabilities.

Install pinned frontend tooling & dependencies, then run local static checks:

```sh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm desktop:static
```

Use generated `ci` & `release-candidate` Actions lanes for compilation, seven Rust quality gates, frontend build & exact-artifact Mac/Windows hidden QA. [Release instructions](docs/releasing.md) describe qualification evidence. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) defines contribution & clean-room rules.
