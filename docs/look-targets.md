# Look targets

A preset copies slider values; a look target copies the *result*. Feed Ember finished sample photos (your exports, any camera) & it extracts the statistics they have in common; apply the target to another photo & Auto refits that photo's own eight values until it lands on the same statistics. Every photo gets its own exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks & vibrance, yet the batch shares one histogram shape. Deterministic & resolution-independent (`crates/pipeline/src/look.rs`).

## Extract

```text
lightcraft-cli look extract sample1.jpg sample2.jpg sample3.jpg -o look.json
```

Samples are rendered files (JPEG / PNG / TIFF…; raws are refused: a raw has no look yet). Each sample is decoded to display-linear Rec. 2020 (at most 1024 px) & measured:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `luminance` | encoded (gamma 2.2) output luminance at the 1st, 5th, 50th, 95th & 99.5th percentiles |
| `clip` | share of the frame at or over white |
| `chroma` | Oklab chroma at the 50th & 90th percentiles |

Each field is the **median across samples**, so one odd frame does not pull the look. Five to twenty samples of one style work well; a single sample works (`samples: 1`). The file is schema `lightcraft.look-target.v1` & refuses to overwrite without `--force`. `LookTarget::validate` rejects anything else (wrong schema, non-finite, out of range, non-ascending percentiles, unknown fields).

## Apply

```text
lightcraft-cli run --import photo.raf develop.applyLook path=look.json app.export path=out.jpg longEdge=2000
```

`develop.applyLook` (engine command: UI, CLI, MCP & control channel; params `look` inline or `path`, `dryRun`) does, on the photo's 512 px proxy under its current white balance, profile & crop:

1. **Scene population**: the same scene EVs & scene key Auto measures (`auto::scene_population`, `SceneKey`).
2. **Shaping fit**: `auto::fit::fit_with` with the look's statistics as [`Targets`](auto-tone.md) (top = p99.5, bottom = p1, spread = p95 − p5, median = p50, clip). The key weights still soften the contrast term so a night frame is not forced to a daylight spread.
3. **Exposure against the real render**: the proxy is rendered through the actual pipeline (float linear Rec. 2020) & exposure bisected (10 steps, ±2 EV around the tone-map estimate) until the rendered median meets the look's. This is a true closed loop: local stages the fit only models (the edge-aware highlight/shadow base) are in the render.
4. **Vibrance** from the rendered 90th-percentile chroma vs the look's: `40 × log2(want / have)`, clamped ±40.

One undo step. `dryRun: true` returns the values without editing. Regressions (`look::tests`): a sample rendered a stop brighter & flatter, applied to a frame 1.5 stops darker, lands within 0.03 of the look's median & 0.08 of its highlight percentile; a muted sample pulls vibrance down; hostile targets are refused before any edit; repeat-stable.

## Limits & next

- Tone & colourfulness only: no hue shifts, split toning, curves or grain are transferred (a preset does those; a look target & a preset combine: apply the preset, then the target).
- Percentile statistics do not see *where* tones sit. Spatial targets (centre vs edge, sky vs ground) & face-weighted exposure follow the same path as Auto's next steps (`auto-tone.md`).
- Batch: `develop.applyLook` with `ids` is not yet implemented; drive it per photo (CLI `run`, MCP) or via sync after one apply.
- Personal style from accepted edits (`personal-auto-evaluation.md`) is the learned counterpart: a look target needs no training & five samples; a residual model needs hundreds of accepted edits & qualifies against held-out shoots.
