# Auto tone

`develop.auto` (`crates/pipeline/src/auto.rs`) is deterministic & closed-loop. Same pixels, same source kind, same white balance → same eight values, byte for byte, on every platform (f32 statistics, fixed sample stride, fixed iteration order & count, no clock, no randomness).

## Stages

1. **Proxy.** Box-fit to 512 px, white balance & scene-linear preparation as the pipeline does it, then every finite pixel's scene EV (`log2(Y / 0.18)`) & Oklab chroma. The key's median is **centre-weighted**: half the frame's median, half the median of the central ellipse (`CENTRE_R2`, about 28 % of the frame), so a dark subject against a bright sky or a lit face in a dark room sets the key more than the frame's edges (regression `auto_is_centre_weighted_and_so_spatially_sensitive`: the same pixels shuffled give a different Auto, as the Lightroom findings of 2026-10-10 showed theirs does). Percentiles for highlights, shadows & clipping stay frame-wide.
2. **Scene key** (`SceneKey`). Low-key, high-key & backlit are continuous weights in 0..=1 from smooth steps on the EV percentiles, never branches. Two frames of one burst that straddle a threshold get nearly the same values (regression `burst_frames_across_a_key_threshold_get_nearly_the_same_auto`: the old branch moved exposure by 0.9 EV between frames 6 % apart).
3. **Exposure.** An exact rule: exposure is a gain before the tone curve, so `target_key − median` lands the median where the key wants it (0 EV ordinary, −0.9 low-key, +0.65 high-key, blended). Backlit scenes cap exposure near +2 EV so recovery handles the tail instead of lifting a dark foreground several stops.
4. **Shaping fit** (`auto::fit`). Contrast, highlights, shadows, whites & blacks are fitted against a per-pixel model of the finish stage: finish's own highlight/shadow log-luminance offsets (the pixel's luminance stands in for the edge-aware base plane) followed by the source's real tone map (`ToneMap::camera` / `new` / `display`, chosen as `finish` chooses). Targets on the rendered histogram: bright tail reaches white without clipping (also measured in EV against the tone map's white point, which stays informative where the output saturates), blacks reach near black, ordinary mid-tone spread, median kept where exposure put it. Coordinate descent in fixed slider order with a fixed step schedule (16, 8, 4, 2) over four passes, bounded to Auto's ranges (highlights only recover, shadows only lift), with regularisation that keeps sliders modest where they buy nothing. Cost per evaluation: ≤ 4096 samples × two LUT lookups.
5. **Colour.** Vibrance & saturation from the 90th-percentile chroma headroom (unchanged rules).

Why closed-loop: the previous rules mapped percentiles straight to slider values & assumed each slider's effect was linear & independent. Tone-curve tuning silently detuned Auto, & a display-referred JPEG (clips at 1.0) got the same recovery as a raw with a Reinhard shoulder. The fit reads the tone map, so Auto follows the pipeline (regression `fitted_sliders_track_the_tone_map_of_the_source_kind`).

## Region-aware Auto

A global fit cannot serve a subject against a washed-out background: the subject wants lifting, the background wants its contrast, blacks & haze back. `auto::regions::region_auto` (`develop.auto`'s default; `regions: false` gives the global fit alone) splits the photo by the Subject & Sky mask shapes, today the classical heuristics in `crates/pipeline/src/masks.rs` (a segmentation model drops in behind the same shapes), & treats three regions:

1. **Regions** on the 512 px proxy: subject = Subject alpha ≥ 0.6, sky = Sky alpha ≥ 0.6, background = the rest. A region counts with ≥ 4 % of the valid pixels & a 5th–95th percentile spread ≥ 0.1 EV; a subject over 90 % of the frame leaves no background. No usable subject → the global Auto, exactly.
2. **Global fit** as above, but the key median is half the frame's, half the subject's (instead of the central ellipse).
3. **Region fits**: the same closed-loop fit on each region's own pixels, each region moving only in its restoring direction (a fit against whole-scene targets would otherwise flatten a subject or brighten a background, & a heuristic mask is not precise enough to be trusted with more). Subject: its median to the scene's key target (local exposure) & shadows 0..40. Background: key kept, contrast 0..30 & blacks −35..0 from its fit, dehaze 0..25 from how far its 5th percentile sits above black under the global render (0 at 0.12, full at 0.37 encoded) scaled by how flat it is (full below 0.5 EV of 5th–95th spread, none above 1.5: a bright wall has lifted blacks too, but spread). Sky: highlights −60..0 & whites −30..0. Local values are the region's fit minus the global one.
4. **Settle**: the subject's local exposure is bisected (8 steps over −0.5..+2 EV: a dark subject is lifted, a bright one left bright, only pulled back a little when far above the key) against the real render of the proxy with every mask in place, until the subject region's encoded median meets the key target. Local slider units differ from the global ones & a soft mask applies only part of a value; the render is the truth. Auto takes about 1 s on a 24 MP raw (0.5 s without regions).
5. **Output**: the eight global values plus masks named `Auto: subject` / `Auto: background` / `Auto: sky` (one semantic component each) with the local adjustments, only where any is non-zero. The next Auto replaces masks it wrote (`is_auto_mask`: that name & a single semantic shape); a renamed or extended one is the user's & stays. One undo step.

Regression `a_dark_subject_on_a_washed_out_background_gets_two_treatments`: subject region median within 0.06 of the key target in the real render, brighter than under the global Auto, background blacks deeper; repeat-identical. The masks are evaluated on the uncropped, unrotated proxy. Personal Auto's baseline receipts bind to the global `auto_tone` (unchanged, revision v3); region masks are not part of them.

## Auto white balance

`auto::neutral_wb` is a grey-world mean weighted towards mid-tone pixels with a strong low-chroma preference (`(1 − chroma)⁴`: a coloured wall or field that fills most of the frame still loses to the neutrals that are there; regression `auto_wb_resists_a_large_coloured_surface…`). It is exact on a uniform patch, which is what the white-balance picker samples. `auto::auto_wb` (Develop ▸ WB ▸ Auto) is the same estimate with the tint held within ±60 (`MAX_TINT`): real illuminants sit near the Planckian / daylight locus, so a larger green–magenta estimate is a coloured scene, not a coloured light. Non-finite or negative pixels are skipped; an all-invalid frame returns as-shot. Qualifying a better illuminant estimator (shades-of-grey, grey-edge, learned) needs a ground-truth illuminant set under a usable licence; a p = 6 shades-of-grey variant was tried & dropped: it made the coloured-wall case worse.

## Pieces other features reuse

`auto::scene_population` (the proxy's sorted scene EVs, percentiles & chroma), `SceneKey`, `auto::fit::Targets` / `auto_targets` / `fit_with`, `encode` & `tone_map` are public: look targets ([`look-targets.md`](look-targets.md)) feed measured statistics into the same fit; Personal Auto adds a learned residual on top of the result.

## Contract for offline work

`auto::REVISION` names the rules (`lightcraft.deterministic-auto.v3`: v2 added the closed-loop fit & continuous keys, v3 the centre-weighted key); Personal Auto receipts bind to it & reject stale baselines. Changing any constant above is a new revision.

## Next

A segmentation model behind the Subject / Sky shapes (the region-aware Auto improves with it, no code change), face weighting of the exposure target (YuNet is in `crates/segment`; its weights are not yet pinned for product use), raw clipped-channel share capping recovery, scene priors from DINOv2 embeddings blended by probability, & spatial / face-weighted look targets. Evaluation: `docs/personal-auto-evaluation.md` (shoot-disjoint preference against this baseline).
